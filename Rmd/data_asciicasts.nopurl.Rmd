NOTES:

-   This file is *not* included in the [source package](https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html#source-package) because of the [`.nopurl` suffix in its
    filename](https://rpkg.dev/pkgpurl/reference/purl_rmd.html#-rmd-files-excluded-from-purling).

-   The chunks below have to be manually executed in order to regenerate the package data.

# asciicasts

NOTES:

-   asciicasts are only regenerated manually because their generation takes a considerable amount of time. To regenerate an asciicast, manually run its code
    chunk, rebuild the package and finally re-build the vignette(s) where it's included.

-   After asciicasts are regenerated (and stored as JSON files under `inst/asciicasts/`), the package must be rebuilt in order to actually include the updated
    JSON files.

-   The asciicast player width of 116 chars (`cols = 116L`) is optimized for the current pkgdown layout of `rpkg.dev`.

## SOME ASCIICAST

```{r}
fs::dir_create("inst/asciicasts")
tmp_file <- fs::file_temp(ext = "R")

c('SOME_R_CODE_TO_CAST() %>%
  readr::write_lines(file = tmp_file)

asciicast::record(script = tmp_file,
                  title = "SOME TITLE",
                  startup = quote(options(cli.width = 115L)),
                  timeout = 180L,
                  typing_speed = 0L,
                  rows = 50L,
                  cols = 116L,
                  speed = 1.0) %>%
  asciicast::write_json(path = "inst/asciicasts/SOME_ASCIICAST.json")

fs::file_delete(tmp_file)
